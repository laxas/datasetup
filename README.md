# Basic Setup for Data Analysis
My personal setup for data analysis.

The included packages can be found in the file `Pipenv`.

To create the virtual environment and install all the packages run the following commands:

<code bash>
pipenv shell --three
pipenv install
</code>

To start a jupyter session run ...

<code bash>
jupyter lab
</code>
